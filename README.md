I am John, I'm interested in learning some coding skills while I attend coolege. I currently have zero programming skills. The only advantage I have is the ability to type at a decent speed. I hope to make a career out of programming. I know i Have to invest a lot of time into learning how to code. So, I'm getting the ball rolling now.
